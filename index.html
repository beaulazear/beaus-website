      <h2>Julie & Ralph</h2>
      <img src="Ralph.jpeg" height="382.5" width="286.875" alt="Ralph"><img src="IMG_3417.JPG" height="382.5" width="286.875"
        alt="Beau and Ralph"><img src="RalphAndRu.jpeg" height="382.5" width="286.875" alt="Ralph">
      <p class="testimonialBio">Beau is the absolute best! Like many pet owners, my pup, Ralph, means the world to me
        and it takes a lot for me
        to trust someone. Beau always keeps me updated on the walks and any new friends that Ralph makes. His daily
        recap texts include pictures which I joke is like I hired a professional photographer as an added bonus. I think
        the favorite part of Ralph's day is when Beau arrives, he knows he'll get fresh air, lots of love and a few
        treats.</p>

      <h2>Anna + Anna & Ruthie</h2>

        alt="Ruthie"><img src="Ruth3.jpeg" height="382.5" width="286.875" alt="Ruthie">
      <p class="testimonialBio">From the moment our Ruthie met Beau, she was in love. We say his name and her tail wags
        with delight. And if we
        had tails, we would wag them too! Beau is communicative and professional, clear and detailed with his walking
        reports and pet sits. We trust him profoundly with our excitable and sometimes too stubborn mini goldendoodle.
        He loves her as if she was his own, with great care and compassion. When he walks her, our busy lives are made
        easier. We come home to a happily walked and calm dog after each and every visit. We couldn’t recommend Beau
        with higher praise and feel lucky that Ruthie gets to spend time with him.</p>

      <p class="testimonialBio">Admittedly, it's not easy for me to leave my pup, River, with anyone… except for Beau. I
        met Beau at a nearby dog park and knew instantly that he was a genuine and compassionate animal lover. He proves
        that time and time again, going above and beyond to keep River happy and safe. Beau is thoughtful, dependable,
        responsible, and incredibly kind. He communicates thoroughly and sends detailed summaries (with adorable
        photographs!) after every walk. We are incredibly grateful that we found Beau and could not possibly recommend
        him more!</p>

        alt="Java and Reyka posing for treats">
      <p class="testimonialBio">I can't recommend Beau enough. Above all, he values each pet's safety and comfort. He is
        passionate about connecting with and understanding the needs of animals, which I have seen in his connection
        with Java, our 15 year old goldendoodle. Beau is reliable, communicative, and extremely thoughtful, and Java is
        consistently excited to see him. Beau took time to get to know Java and we are so grateful to put her in his
        care.

      <p class="testimonialBio">I highly recommend Beau as a dog walker and dog sitter. Beau has been regularly walking
        our dog Moose and has consistently provided excellent care, and our dog absolutely loves him! Beau is extremely
        reliable, and always goes above and beyond to make sure Moose is happy and has a good walk. Beau’s extremely
        accommodating of our schedules, and has saved us on multiple occasions when we last minute needed dog care. I’m
        really thankful for his flexibility and kindness. Beau has dog sat for Moose on several occasions and has always provided exceptional care during his stays. He
        sends regular updates about walks / dog sits and provides awesome pictures with each update. I trust Beau completely and am so grateful to have him as Moose's dog walker and dog sitter.
