        <div class="testimonialBio">I am based in Brooklyn NYC. I've had an eventful professional life involving multiple direct animal care positions, administrative & hospitality roles (within plant-based / cruelty free establishments), and more. I've grown within these rolls, and completed several educational programs / projects throughout my experience. I am currently maintaining my own business - providing exceptional animal care to clients across Brooklyn NYC. I am self taught in basic computer programming, and I am currently in an educational program to expand my understanding even further. Proficiency in HTML, Javascript, React, CSS, Ruby, and more as I continue to learn. See <a href="projects.html">Projects Page</a> to view some of my programming portfolio.</div>
