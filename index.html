      <p id="aboutBio">Hi! My name is Beau, and I am based in Brooklyn NYC. My whole life I have longed to work with / help animals in anyway possible. I've had an eventful professional life involving multiple direct animal care positions, administrative & hospitality roles (within plant-based / cruelty free establishments), and more. I've grown within these rolls, and completed several educational programs / projects throughout my experience. I am currently maintaining my own business - providing exceptional animal care to clients across Brooklyn NYC. I am self taught in basic computer programming (HTML, CSS), and I am currently in an educational program to expand my understanding even further.</p>
