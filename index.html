      <h2>Julie & Ralph</h2>

      <p>Beau is the absolute best! Like many pet owners, my pup, Ralph, means the world to me and it takes a lot for me
        to trust someone. Beau always keeps me updated on the walks and any new friends that Ralph makes. His daily
        recap texts include pictures which I joke is like I hired a professional photographer as an added bonus. I think
        the favorite part of Ralph's day is when Beau arrives, he knows he'll get fresh air, lots of love and a few
        treats.</p>

      <p>Admittedly, it's not easy for me to leave my pup, River, with anyoneâ€¦ except for Beau. I met Beau at a nearby dog park and knew instantly that he was a genuine and compassionate animal lover. He proves that time and time again, going above and beyond to keep River happy and safe. Beau is thoughtful, dependable, responsible, and incredibly kind. He communicates thoroughly and sends detailed summaries (with adorable photographs!) after every walk. We are incredibly grateful that we found Beau and could not possibly recommend him more!</p>
