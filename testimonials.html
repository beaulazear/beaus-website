            <div class="testimonialBio">Beau is the absolute best! Like many pet owners, my pup, Ralph, means the world to
                me
                and it takes a lot for me
                to trust someone. Beau always keeps me updated on the walks and any new friends that Ralph makes. His
                daily
                recap texts include pictures which I joke is like I hired a professional photographer as an added bonus.
                I think
                the favorite part of Ralph's day is when Beau arrives, he knows he'll get fresh air, lots of love and a
                few
                treats.</div>

            <div class="testiClient"><h2><u>Anna + Anna and Ruthie</u></h2></div>            <div class="testimonialBio">From the moment our Ruthie met Beau, she was in love. We say his name and her tail
                wags
                with delight. And if we
                had tails, we would wag them too! Beau is communicative and professional, clear and detailed with his
                walking
                reports and pet sits. We trust him profoundly with our excitable and sometimes too stubborn mini
                goldendoodle.
                He loves her as if she was his own, with great care and compassion. When he walks her, our busy lives
                are made
                easier. We come home to a happily walked and calm dog after each and every visit. We couldn’t recommend
                Beau
                with higher praise and feel lucky that Ruthie gets to spend time with him.</div>

                <div class="testimonialBio">Admittedly, it's not easy for me to leave my pup, River, with anyone… except for
                Beau. I
                met Beau at a nearby dog park and knew instantly that he was a genuine and compassionate animal lover.
                He proves
                that time and time again, going above and beyond to keep River happy and safe. Beau is thoughtful,
                dependable,
                responsible, and incredibly kind. He communicates thoroughly and sends detailed summaries (with adorable
                photographs!) after every walk. We are incredibly grateful that we found Beau and could not possibly
                recommend
                him more!</div>

            <div class="testimonialBio">I can't recommend Beau enough. Above all, he values each pet's safety and comfort.
                He is
                passionate about connecting with and understanding the needs of animals, which I have seen in his
                connection
                with Java, our 15 year old goldendoodle. Beau is reliable, communicative, and extremely thoughtful, and
                Java is
                consistently excited to see him. Beau took time to get to know Java and we are so grateful to put her in
                his
                care.</div>

            <div class="testimonialBio">I highly recommend Beau as a dog walker and dog sitter. Beau has been regularly
                walking
                our dog Moose and has consistently provided excellent care, and our dog absolutely loves him! Beau is
                extremely
                reliable, and always goes above and beyond to make sure Moose is happy and has a good walk. Beau’s
                extremely
                accommodating of our schedules, and has saved us on multiple occasions when we last minute needed dog
                care. I’m
                really thankful for his flexibility and kindness. Beau has dog sat for Moose on several occasions and
                has always provided exceptional care during his stays. He
                sends regular updates about walks / dog sits and provides awesome pictures with each update. I trust
                Beau completely and am so grateful to have him as Moose's dog walker and dog sitter.</div>
