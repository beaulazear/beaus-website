                <h3>Free of charge :)</h3>
                <p>With my animal rescue / veterinary experience, I have been there for a lot of euthanasia. I know this
                    can be a very tough moment for an animal lover! I would like to offer my company free of charge...
                    To be with you during the euthanasia visit, so you do not have to go through it alone. I am also
                    more than happy to spend some time with you afterwards. It is always helpful to have someone to talk
                    to :)<br><br><br><br>
