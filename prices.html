<h2>Euthanasia Support:</h2>
<h4>❤️Free of charge❤️<br>
With my animal rescue / veterinary experience I have been there for a lot of euthanasia<br>
I know this can be a very tough moment for an animal owner<br>
I would like to offer myself free of charge...<br>
To accompany you during the euthanasia visit, so you do not have to go through it alone<br>
I am also more than happy to spend some time with you afterwards<br>
It is always helpful to have someone to talk to<br>
